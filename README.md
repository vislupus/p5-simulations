# Simulations with p5.js

## About

This repository showcases a diverse range of captivating simulations, all built using the powerful [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library.

This collection features interactive simulations covering a wide array of fascinating topics. Each simulation is meticulously crafted to provide an engaging and immersive experience.

The inspiration for many of these simulations comes from the brilliant work of [Daniel Shiffman](http://twitter.com/shiffman) and his incredible YouTube channel, [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw). Through his tutorials and creative coding projects, Daniel has inspired countless developers and artists to explore the exciting world of coding.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of the simulations you can find in this repository:
